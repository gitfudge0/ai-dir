   - Analyze concurrent processing: thread safety, deadlock prevention, resource contention.
   - Evaluate async operations: proper error handling, timeout management, backpressure handling.
   - Check for performance testing coverage and benchmark regression detection.
   - Review scaling strategies and load handling capabilities.
   - Assess resource cleanup and connection management practices.

6. **Compliance and Regulatory Review**:
   - Evaluate compliance with relevant standards: PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, ISO 27001.
   - Review data privacy implementation: consent management, data minimization, right to deletion.
   - Check audit trail completeness and tamper resistance.
   - Assess data retention policies and secure deletion practices.
   - Review access logging and user activity monitoring.

# Agentic Coding Agents Repository

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of agentic coding agents designed to assist developers in various programming tasks. The agents are specialized for Python and frontend development, providing tools and utilities to streamline coding, testing, and documentation processes. The repository aims to enhance productivity, enforce best practices, and ensure code quality across projects.

## Features

- **Python Development Agents**:

  - Assist with code generation, testing, and debugging.
  - Follow PEP 8 and PEP 257 standards with Black formatting.
  - Provide type hints, context managers, and logging utilities.
  - Support test-driven development (TDD) with pytest.

- **Frontend Development Agents**:

  - Ensure semantic HTML and WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance.
  - Optimize for Core Web Vitals and cross-browser compatibility.
  - Provide linting, formatting, and testing tools for React/Next.js projects.
  - Enforce secure coding practices, including input sanitization and HTTPS.

- **Documentation Agents**:

  - Generate comprehensive technical documentation.
  - Support Divio documentation framework (tutorials, how-to guides, references, explanations).
  - Ensure accessibility and clarity in documentation.

- **Specialized Agents**:
  - Security audit agents for identifying vulnerabilities.
  - Research agents for gathering and summarizing technical information.
  - Specification generation agents for creating detailed project specs.
